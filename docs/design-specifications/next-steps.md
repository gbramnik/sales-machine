# Next Steps

## Immediate Actions

1. **Review with Stakeholder (Gary):**
   - Present wireframe descriptions
   - Validate design direction aligns with vision
   - Confirm component library choices (shadcn/ui + Tailwind)

2. **Create High-Fidelity Mockups (Optional):**
   - If budget allows, create Figma mockups for 3 core screens
   - Useful for frontend developer reference, but not blocking
   - Wireframe descriptions are sufficient for development

3. **Handoff to Frontend Developer:**
   - Share this document
   - Provide shadcn/ui component installation commands
   - Schedule kickoff meeting to walk through designs

4. **Parallel Track - Backend API:**
   - Architect defines API endpoints needed for UI
   - Example: `GET /api/review-queue` returns messages array
   - Mock API responses for frontend development (can build UI before backend ready)
