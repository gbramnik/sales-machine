# Non-functional requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "SMTP credentials encrypted in api_credentials table. Domain verification ensures proper DNS configuration. RLS policies enforced. Webhook signature verification."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Redis-based email queue with VIP priority. Efficient sorted set implementation. Hourly scheduler workflow optimized for batch processing."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Hard-coded sending limits prevent domain burn. Warm-up period enforcement protects deliverability. Auto-pause triggers on bounce/spam thresholds. Comprehensive error handling."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Well-structured service layer (SMTPService, EmailQueueService, DomainWarmupService, EmailSendingLimitService). Comprehensive unit tests. Clear separation of concerns."
