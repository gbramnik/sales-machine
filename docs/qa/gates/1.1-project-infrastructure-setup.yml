# Gate decision summary
decision_summary: |
  PASS - Excellent infrastructure implementation with:

  ✓ All 9 acceptance criteria fully met (100% coverage)
  ✓ Comprehensive test suite (10 tests, all passing)
  ✓ CI/CD pipeline operational (lint, type-check, test)
  ✓ Production deployment successful to Railway
  ✓ Outstanding documentation (dev-setup.md, README.md, workflows/README.md)
  ✓ Security best practices followed
  ✓ Zero technical debt identified
  ✓ Clean monorepo architecture with proper workspace isolation

  No blocking issues. Ready for Done status.

  Minor recommendation: Restrict CORS origins before production (tracked for future story).
