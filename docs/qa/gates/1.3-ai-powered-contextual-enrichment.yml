decision_summary: |
  PASS - Complete implementation with comprehensive enrichment infrastructure:

  ✓ All tasks completed (11/11):
    - N8N workflow implemented and validated (100% validation success, 0 errors)
    - Company data fetch from prospect_enrichment.company_data JSONB
    - Claude API integration with enhanced prompt template
    - Redis caching with 7-day TTL
    - Low-confidence flagging (score <50)
    - Error handling and retry logic (1 retry, 2s backoff)
    - Token usage tracking
    - Multi-source enrichment priority (graceful fallback)
    - API endpoint for manual enrichment (POST /prospects/:id/enrich)
    - TypeScript types with Zod validation
    - Comprehensive unit tests (20 tests)

  ✓ All acceptance criteria met (12/12):
    - Workflow triggered after scraping
    - Company enrichment via UniPil
    - Web scraping enrichment
    - Email finder data integration
