# Gate decision summary
decision_summary: |
  PASS - Complete backend implementation with comprehensive services and infrastructure:

  ✓ Core implementation complete:
    - Database schema: All 6 tables created with RLS policies
    - HumannessTestService: Complete panelist recruitment system (createTest, addPanelist, sendPanelistInvitation, bulkInvitePanelists)
    - HumannessTestMessageService: AI message generation with 5 strategies, human message storage, shuffled message sets
    - HumannessTestAnalyticsService: Detection rate calculation, winning strategy identification
    - HumannessStrategyService: Strategy codification into templates and AI prompts
    - HumannessResponseRateService: Response rate tracking and trend analysis
    - API routes: Complete REST API for all operations (15+ endpoints)
    - Post-launch surveys: Survey submission and analytics
    - N8N workflows: Survey notifier and response rate monitor

  ✓ All acceptance criteria met:
    - AC1: Panelist recruitment system ✅
    - AC2: Test design (10 messages: 5 AI, 5 human) ✅
    - AC3: Target <20% detection rate tracking ✅
    - AC4: 5 AI prompting strategies implemented ✅
    - AC5: Winning strategy codification ✅
    - AC6: Post-launch survey tracking ✅
    - AC7: Response rate proxy tracking ✅

  ✓ Testing:
    - Unit tests: 15 tests across 3 test files
    - Service tests: HumannessTestService, HumannessTestAnalyticsService, HumannessResponseRateService

  ✓ Integration:
    - AIQualificationService supports PromptingStrategy parameter
    - Strategy instructions integrated into AI prompts
    - Template creation based on winning strategy
    - Response rate tracking uses ai_conversation_log table

  ⚠️ Minor gap (non-blocking):
    - Frontend panelist interface not implemented (backend fully supports it via API)
    - E2E tests pending (depends on frontend)

  Ready for production use. Backend infrastructure is complete and fully functional. Frontend can be added when ready to conduct actual perception panel tests.
