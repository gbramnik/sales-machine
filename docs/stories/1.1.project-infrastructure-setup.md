# Story 1.1: Project Infrastructure Setup

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** the foundational technical infrastructure configured,
**so that** I can build features on a stable, scalable foundation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Monorepo created with `/workflows`, `/api`, `/frontend`, `/mcp-servers`, `/docs`, `/scripts`, `/tests` folder structure
2. GitHub repository initialized with README, .gitignore, and branch protection (main branch)
3. Supabase project created with PostgreSQL database, Auth configured for OAuth2 (Google/LinkedIn SSO)
4. Upstash Redis instance created (free tier) with connection credentials stored in environment variables
5. N8N Cloud account setup with workspace created and webhook endpoints documented
6. Railway project created for API Gateway hosting with environment variables configured (Supabase URL, Upstash credentials, N8N webhook URLs)
7. GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline configured for linting and basic tests (runs on PR creation)
8. Local development environment documentation complete (setup instructions in /docs/dev-setup.md)
9. N8N workflows deployed to N8N Cloud workspace with webhook URLs captured and documented in /workflows/README.md. Deployment script (scripts/deploy-workflows.sh) tested and added to CI/CD pipeline with manual approval gate

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Monorepo Structure:**
The project uses npm workspaces (not Turborepo/Lerna) for simplicity. Root package.json defines workspaces pointing to apps/web, apps/api, and packages/shared. This allows shared type definitions and utilities to be imported across frontend and backend with automatic hoisting of common dependencies.
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#repository-structure]

**Technology Versions:**
- Node.js: v20 LTS
- npm: v10+
- TypeScript: 5.3+
- React: 18.2+
- Fastify: 4.24+
- Supabase CLI: Latest
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]

**Infrastructure Regions:**
- Supabase: eu-west-1 (Ireland) for GDPR compliance
- Railway: Europe deployment (Frankfurt)
- Upstash Redis: eu-west-1 (Ireland)
- N8N Cloud: EU infrastructure
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#platform-and-infrastructure-choice]

**Environment Variables Required:**
Frontend (.env.local):
- VITE_API_URL (http://localhost:3000 for dev)
- VITE_SUPABASE_URL
- VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

Backend (.env):
- DATABASE_URL (Supabase PostgreSQL connection string)
- REDIS_URL (Upstash Redis REST API URL)
- N8N_WEBHOOK_URL (N8N Cloud webhook base URL)
- N8N_API_KEY (N8N API key for workflow deployment)
- CLAUDE_API_KEY (defer to Story 1.3)
- INSTANTLY_API_KEY (defer to Story 1.5)
- CAL_COM_API_KEY (defer to Story 1.7)
[Source: architecture/development-workflow.md#environment-configuration]

**Supabase Auth Configuration:**
OAuth2 providers: Google and LinkedIn SSO required. Configuration done via Supabase dashboard under Authentication > Providers. Requires setting up OAuth apps in Google Cloud Console and LinkedIn Developer Portal to obtain client IDs and secrets. JWT tokens stored in httpOnly cookies (managed by Supabase Auth).
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
[Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md#authentication-security]

**GitHub Branch Protection Rules:**
Main branch requires:
- Pull request before merging
- Passing CI checks (lint, type-check, test)
- No force pushes allowed
[Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md#deployment-strategy]

**Railway Deployment Configuration:**
- Build command: `npm run build --workspace=apps/api` (backend), `npm run build --workspace=apps/web` (frontend)
- Start command: `node apps/api/dist/server.js`
- Auto-deploy: Enabled on push to main branch
- Monorepo detection: Railway auto-detects apps/web and apps/api as separate services
[Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md#deployment-strategy]

**N8N Workflow Deployment:**
Workflows stored as JSON files in /workflows directory. Deployment script (scripts/deploy-workflows.sh) uses N8N Cloud API to upload workflows. Script must validate N8N_API_KEY exists, iterate through /workflows/*.json files, and use multipart/form-data upload via curl. Include success/failure logging and exit with error code if any workflow fails to deploy.
[Source: architecture/development-workflow.md#n8n-workflow-deployment]

**CI/CD Pipeline:**
GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yaml) runs on pull_request and push events:
1. Checkout code
2. Setup Node.js 20
3. npm install
4. npm run generate:types (Supabase type generation)
5. npm run type-check
6. npm run lint
7. npm run test
[Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md#cicd-pipeline]

**Local Development Commands:**
- `npm install`: Install all dependencies (run from root)
- `supabase start`: Start local Supabase instance
- `npm run generate:types`: Generate TypeScript types from Supabase schema
- `npm run dev`: Start both frontend and backend in parallel
- `npm run dev:web`: Start frontend only (Vite dev server on port 5173)
- `npm run dev:api`: Start backend only (Fastify on port 3000)
[Source: architecture/development-workflow.md#local-development-setup]

**Type Safety Architecture:**
Auto-generated types flow: Database Schema → `supabase gen types typescript` → packages/shared/types/database.types.ts → manual business logic types in packages/shared/types/*.ts → imported by apps/api and apps/web. Runtime validation using Zod schemas for N8N webhooks and external API responses.
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#type-safety-architecture]

**Project Structure Verification:**
Created structure must match:
```
sales-machine/
├── .github/workflows/
├── apps/
│   ├── web/
│   └── api/
├── packages/
│   └── shared/
├── workflows/

├── scripts/

### Testing

**Testing Framework:** Vitest for both frontend and backend unit tests, Playwright for E2E tests (defer E2E to later stories)
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-pyramid]

**Test Organization:**
- Frontend tests: apps/web/tests/unit/
- Backend tests: apps/api/tests/unit/
- Integration tests: apps/api/tests/integration/
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]

**Test Requirements for This Story:**
- CI pipeline test: Create minimal passing test in apps/api/tests/unit/ and apps/web/tests/unit/ to verify CI runs
- No functional tests required for infrastructure setup itself
- Focus: Verify CI pipeline executes test command successfully

**Testing Standards:**
- Use Vitest for all unit tests
- Test files named: *.test.ts or *.test.tsx
- Run tests with: `npm run test`
- CI must fail if any test fails
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-examples]
