# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **Sales Machine**, an AI-powered autonomous sales prospecting platform. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration, streamlining the development process for a modern fullstack application where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**Decision:** Greenfield project with custom monorepo structure

**Rationale:**
- N8N as core orchestration engine is non-standard (most starters assume Next.js/Express)
- MCP architecture layer is custom (no starter supports this)
- Supabase + Upstash + N8N Cloud combination is unique
- Solo-preneur operational model requires maximum flexibility

No existing starter template perfectly fits the N8N-centric workflow orchestration approach combined with the MCP abstraction layer and multi-cloud managed services architecture.
