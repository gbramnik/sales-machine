# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Enable solo entrepreneurs and SMBs to achieve enterprise-scale prospecting capabilities (equivalent to a 10-person sales team) without human intervention
- Generate 10-30 qualified meetings/month consistently for users through autonomous AI-powered multi-channel outreach
- Validate Micro-MVP (LinkedIn + Email + Basic AI Agent) within 6 weeks with 5 beta users generating 3+ qualified meetings each
- Achieve €10K MRR within 6 months of launch with 50 paying customers at €200 average MRR
- Maintain solo-preneur operational model through 100 customers, proving scalability without requiring team expansion
- Position Sales Machine as "the all-bound AI prospecting platform" within French B2B SaaS community by Month 12

## Background Context

Traditional sales prospecting forces businesses to choose between inbound OR outbound strategies while being limited to single channels (email-only or LinkedIn-only tools). Existing solutions like Lemlist, Instantly, Apollo, and Clay are fragmented - requiring manual integration of 10+ point solutions with no true autonomous AI qualification. French-speaking SMBs and solo entrepreneurs spend 20-40 hours/week on manual prospecting that doesn't scale, limits outreach to 50-100 prospects/week, and achieves poor deliverability (40-60% spam folder placement).

Sales Machine converges four pillars into a single platform: (1) Intelligent multi-source targeting across 7+ platforms, (2) Advanced intent signal detection (12+ signals beyond basic job posts/funding), (3) All-bound strategy orchestration (inbound + outbound coordinated), and (4) AI conversational agent for autonomous qualification and meeting booking. The convergence advantage - combining Growth Marketing expertise + massive multi-channel tech stack + sophisticated AI + MCP modular architecture - creates a moat requiring competitors 12-18 months and 10+ person teams to replicate.
